I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Technology at Soochow University, honored with the National Scholarship at both undergraduate and doctoral levels. My research focuses on fault diagnosis of industrial robots and rotating machinery, with particular interests in domain generalization, adversarial learning, few-shot learning, and transfer learning. I have published seven SCI-indexed journal papers and three conference papers, including first-author works in Q1 journals and top-tier automation conferences. I currently lead a Jiangsu Provincial Innovation Project and have participated in national and industrial research projects related to SCARA robot fault diagnosis. I hold one authorized invention patent, with several others under review.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

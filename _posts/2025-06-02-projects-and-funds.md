Currently, I am leading one Jiangsu Provincial Innovation and Practice Project. I previously served as the algorithm design lead for the Inovance-Soochow University joint project titled *"SCARA Robot Fault Diagnosis and Lifetime Prediction"*. I have supervised three undergraduate students in launching national-level innovation projects and one student in a provincial-level project.

1. **2025.05–2026.05: *Research on Small-Scale Robot Fault Perception Models Driven by Multimodal Fusion and Adversarial Games*, Jiangsu Provincial Innovation and Practice Program (Provincial-level, Principal Investigator)**  
2. 2025.05–2026.05: *Research and Application of Industrial Multimodal Heterogeneous Data Fusion and AI Large Model Adaptation Technology*, Junzheng Fund Project (National-level, Advisor to undergraduate student Li Xiang)  
3. 2025.05–2027.05: *Fault Diagnosis of Industrial Robots Based on Multimodal Lightweight Models*, Undergraduate Innovation and Training Program (Provincial-level, Advisor to undergraduate student Gu Likun)  
4. 2024.05–2026.06: *Fault Diagnosis of SCARA Robot Ball Screws Based on Adversarial Game Learning*, Undergraduate Innovation and Training Program (National-level, Advisor to undergraduate student Xu Jingchen)  
5. 2023.05–2026.05: *Cross-Domain Generation of SCARA Robot Fault Features under Time-Varying and Unknown Operating Conditions*, National Natural Science Foundation of China (National-level, Advisor-led, Participant)  
6. 2023.05–2024.05: *Fault Diagnosis of Core Components of SCARA Robots in Industrial Variable Operating Conditions*, Junzheng Fund Project (National-level, Advisor to undergraduate student Wu Sijia)

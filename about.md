- I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Technology at Soochow University. I have been awarded the National Scholarship during both my undergraduate and doctoral studies. 
- I have published seven SCI-indexed journal papers and three conference papers, including one first-author paper in a Q1 SCI journal (Chinese Academy of Sciences ranking), two in Q2 journals, and one in a top-tier conference in the field of automation.
- I am currently leading a Jiangsu Provincial Innovation and Practice Project titled "Research on Small-Scale Fault Perception Models for Robots Driven by Multimodal Fusion and Adversarial Games".
- I have also participated in the Inovance Technologies project "AI Technology Development for SCARA Robot Fault Diagnosis and Life Prediction", as well as the National Natural Science Foundation project "Cross-Domain Generation of Fault Features for SCARA Robots under Time-Varying and Unknown Operating Conditions".
- I have been granted one invention patent titled "A Fault Diagnosis Method for SCARA Robot Ball Screws", with four additional patents under review and one software copyright application in progress.
- My research interests include industrial robot fault diagnosis, rotating machinery fault diagnosis, domain generalization, adversarial learning, few-shot learning, and transfer learning.
